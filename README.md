#Virtual Pet :sparkles:

###Project
Used a Java Threaded Timer to run in background while checking PetPoints agains elapsed time, and updating the UI on matching.

When the user selects an option, then random generated points update Pet's state.

If GamePoints reach maximum value, then game ends.
